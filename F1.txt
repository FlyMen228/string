–Evil is evil, Stregobor, the witcher said seriously, getting up. – Smaller, larger, average – everything is the same, the proportions are conditional, and the boundaries are blurred.
I am not a holy hermit, I have done more than one good thing in my life. But if I have to choose between one evil and another, I prefer not to choose at all.
I have to go. See you tomorrow.
